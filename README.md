# Welcome

Welcome to Learn! Over the next 800-1000 hours you will learn everything you need to know to get started as a professional Data Scientist. Before you get started, a few thoughts about how to make the best use of [learn.co](learn.co). This is going to be the most rewarding learning experience you've ever had, we promise. Let's get started!

## Learning How To Learn

The most common misconception we get when people start this course is that we will teach you programming, math, modeling and visualization. Don't get us wrong, we are going to teach you those things, but that's actually not the most important set of things you're going to learn.

Over your career as a professional data scientist you're going to end up programming in languages and using modeling techniques that haven't even been invented yet. So, the most important thing we can (and we will) teach you is _how to learn_. While covering topics like Python, Statistics, and Regression, we'll work with you to build the skills required to read and understand error messages and to google for answers so once you get a job as a data scientist, when you have to learn a new language, library, or model, you'll know how to quickly get started. We'll also teach you your first set of tools so that you can contribute immediately using them as a professional data scientist.
